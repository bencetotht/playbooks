## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ansible 2.9+
- SSH access to target hosts
- sudo/root privileges on target hosts

### Common Usage Pattern

Each playbook follows a similar structure and usage pattern:

1. **Configure Inventory**: Edit `inventory/hosts.ini` with your target hosts
2. **Set Variables**: Configure `inventory/group_vars/all.yaml` with your environment-specific variables
3. **Run Playbook**: Execute the playbook with appropriate flags

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yaml -i inventory/hosts.ini -b --ask-become-pass
```

**Common Flags:**
- `-b` or `--become`: Enable privilege escalation
- `--ask-become-pass`: Prompt for sudo password
- `--user`: Specify SSH user
- `--key-file`: Specify SSH private key file

### Configuration

Each playbook includes:
- `ansible.cfg`: Ansible configuration with SSH optimizations
- `site.yaml`: Main playbook file
- `inventory/`: Host and variable definitions
- `roles/`: Modular role definitions for specific tasks
